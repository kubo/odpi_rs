# odpi_rs - a thin wrapper over ODPI-C for Rust

Relations between odpic-sys, odpi_rs and oracle crates.

* The odpic-sys crate provides unsafe C functions and types of ODPI-C.
* The odpi_rs crate provides safe intarfaces based on odpic-sys.  
  Its methods correspond one-to-one with ODPI-C functions as possible.
* The oracle crate provides developer-friendly API.

## Goals and non-goals

**Goals**

* Supports all ODPI-C features.
* Provides both sync and async API.

**Non-Goals**

* Provides developer-friendly API including [async iterators].

## Status

In development. Not all features are supported.
Some methods will be changed. Don't use this in production.

## Features flags

The following features can be enable in `Cargo.toml`.

Feature | Descrpition
---|---
`tokio` | Enable async API based on [tokio]
`async-std` | Enable async API based on [async-std]
`smol` | Enable async API based on [smol]

When one of async features is enabled, [ODPI-C functions which may be blocked by network round trips][round_trips]
run in a separate thread provided by the async runtime.

When none of async features are enabled, async API are converted to sync API with the help of the [`maybe_async`] crate.
